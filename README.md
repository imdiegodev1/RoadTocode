# Basic Python exercise

This repository are different exercises that I use to teach about Python programming. Among the files you can find:

-	The basics: #HelloWorld, data types, list, tuples, strings and dictionaries.
-   If statement, operators, for and while bucle.
-	Functions, iterators and ranges.
-   Sorting algorithms, Try-Except and searching algorithms.
-	Classes and OOP.
-	Bonus: a folder with some common excercises used in technical interviews.

I hope they can be of much help if you are just starting in this world or if you want to practice a little.
