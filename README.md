# Road To Code

This repository has scripts of different programming languages. The main idea is to challenge me and learn in the process. Software development is a wide field and it is important to learn more than one programming languages or at least understand the basis sintax of more than one of them. It would help you to get a better idea of how a programming languages work and how it could help you with your projects.

For know you will find here:

- Python
- Java

However, in my GitHub profile you would see more projects focused on other tools and more advanced subjects like data science, backend development and a couple of projects that I have made to test and learn something new.

## Python

There is a folder with different exercises that I use to teach about Python programming. Among the files you can find:

-	The basics: #HelloWorld, data types, list, tuples, strings and dictionaries.
- If statement, operators, for and while loops.
-	Functions, iterators and ranges.
- Sorting algorithms, Try-Except and searching algorithms.
-	Classes and OOP.
-	Bonus: a folder with some common excercises used in technical interviews.

I hope they help if you are just starting in this world or if you want to practice a little.

## Java

In my way to learn more about programming languages (and may be in the future mobile development), I started with different courses to learn Java. In the Java folder you would find:

- The basics: #HelloWorld, data types, list, tuples, strings and dictionaries.
- If statement, operators, for, while and do while loops.
-	Functions, iterators and ranges.


I hope this will be a good starting point to learn or if it is your case to teach about programming.
